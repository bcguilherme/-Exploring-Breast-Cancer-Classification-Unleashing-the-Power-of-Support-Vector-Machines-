# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains code for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Overview

The code uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. It loads the dataset, performs data preprocessing, and splits the data into training and test sets. The SVM model is trained and evaluated for its accuracy in predicting breast cancer types.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Run the provided Python script to load the dataset and train the SVM model.
